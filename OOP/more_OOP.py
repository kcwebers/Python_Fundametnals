# Override

class Parent:
    def method_a(self):
        print("invoking PARENT method_a!")
class Child(Parent):
    def method_a(self):
        print("invoking CHILD method_a!")
dad = Parent()
son = Child()
dad.method_a()
son.method_a() #notice this overrides the Parent method!

# As you can see, when we invoke dad.method_a(), it runs the Parent class' method_a() because that 
# variable (dad) is an instance of the Parent class. However, when we invoke son.method_a(), it runs the 
# Child class' method_a() because the variable son is an instance of the Child class. The Child overrides 
# this method from the parent by defining its own version.

# Polymorphism

# We'll use the Person class to demonstrate polymorphism
# in which multiple classes inherit from the same class but behave in different wayscopy
class Person:
  def pay_bill(self):
      raise NotImplementedError
# Millionaire inherits from Person
class Millionaire(Person):
  def pay_bill(self):
      print("Here you go! Keep the change!")
# Grad Student also inherits from the Person class
class GradStudent(Person):
  def pay_bill(self):
      print("Can I owe you ten bucks or do the dishes

# Based on this example, a Millionaire and a Grad Student are both Persons. However, when it comes to paying a bill, 
# how they act is quite different. This pattern is useful when you know that each subclass of a parent class must 
# define a specific behavior in a method, and you don't want to define a default behavior in the parent class (hence the 
# pure virtual implementation in the parent).
